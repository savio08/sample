                Hi,<br> I'm Athira, a Mathematics student, a self-taught artist, and a lot more. I'm from Kerala and I'm attracted to colours and blank sheets. I started painting Canvases a year before and that was a beautiful turn, to be honest. I'm
                passionate about art and I just want to spread colours in the life of others as well as mine. Currently, I'm trying to improve the quality of my artworks and to add new meanings through Colors.
